Our team created an html form for a [Patient Care Report](http://www.worksheeto.com/postpic/2015/10/ems-patient-care-report-template_563860.png) that was then supposed to be abke to be downlowned as a filled in PDF version of the official report. We got the form working well, and I focused on writing javascript to have the formed be downloaded as a PDF. While we got both working independently, we didn't end up having time to get the two parts working together but we all still had fun.
